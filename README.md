# CSS Modules Crash Course

A [Camp JS VII](http://vii.campjs.com/) Workshop.

The goal is to introduce some of the core principles behind CSS Modules, and give you an experience of getting up and running.

The stages of the course are:

- **CSS Dependencies:** how can we write JS components that declare their own CSS dependencies?
- **Solving the Naming Problem:** how does CSS Modules make it easier to name things?
- **Just Like JS Modules:** CSS Modules are like JS modules in that they can export things and import things.
- **What's in a Name?** Here we learn about the CSS Modules principle of _"compose, don't redefine"_.
- **Variants:** Some useful techniques for composing multiple variants of the same module.
- **PostCSS Plugins:** Coming Soon! Looking into how we can incorporate other PostCSS plugins with CSS Modules.
