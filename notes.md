# CSS Modules Crash Course

Welcome to the CSS Modules workshop!

We'll go through some stages that will help to introduce you to some of the main ideas and features of CSS Modules.

You can take a look at them in the `stages/` directory:

```

  03-just-like-js-modules
  04-whats-in-a-name

```

## Getting started

To start a stage first open a terminal and change to its directory:

cd stages/01-css-dependencies
```

Now run the build command:

```
npm run build
```

And open the `index.html` page in a browser (You can type `npm run open` as a shortcut)
