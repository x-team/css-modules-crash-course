<p>CSS Modules composition is useful for making new components out of existing ones, but sometimes we need to provide multiple states or variations of the same component.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s implement the following features in our game:</p>
<pre><code>As a Player
I want to see which cards are new
So that my micropurchase reflex is triggered</code></pre>
<pre><code>As a Player
I want to know which cards I don&#39;t have enough coins for
So that I can feel bad about myself</code></pre>
<p>To implement these we&#39;ve added 2 new properties to the <code>Card</code> component: <code>isNew</code> and <code>isEnabled</code>. Each of these flags will apply a different visual state to the card. To do this we&#39;ve got 2 classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.new</code>: this class puts a blue circle with the word &quot;NEW&quot; in it, on the top-left corner of the card.</li>
<li><code>.disabled</code>: this class causes the card to appear faded out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, our AB tests have indicated that a player&#39;s micropurchase reflex is heightened when they are already feeling bad about themselves. So we definitely want to be able to combine both the <code>.new</code> and the <code>.disabled</code> classes, as well as using them individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>new</li>
<li>disabled</li>
<li>disabled + new</li>
</ul>
<div id="root"></div>

<div class="core-concept">
<h2>Use <code>composes</code> for making new components, and compose classes manually within the JS component for state-based variations.</h2>
